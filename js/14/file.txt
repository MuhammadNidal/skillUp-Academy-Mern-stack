Class vs Object — explained 

Imagine: a blueprint for a house and one house built from that blueprint.
The class is the blueprint (it describes what things/rooms the house will have).
The object is the actual house built from that blueprint (it has real values).

1) Class (the blueprint)
A class defines the shape and behavior: what properties (data) objects will have, and what methods (actions) they can do.
In JavaScript (modern style) we use the class keyword.
Simple code example — a very small Student class:

class Student {
  // methods and constructor go here
}


Think: “Student” is the blueprint that says every student should have a name, age, and a way to show info.

2) Object (the thing made from the blueprint)
An object is an instance of a class. Each object has its own values.
We create an object from a class using the new keyword.

Example: create two student objects from the Student class:
const student1 = new Student();
const student2 = new Student();


Each student1 and student2 is an independent object you can set values on.
Step-by-step: Class → Constructor → Creating objects
We’ll build a Student class step by step.

Step 0 — Plan what a Student needs
Decide properties and methods:
Properties: name, age, grade

Methods: displayInfo() to show student info

Step 1 — Start the class
class Student {
  // we'll add constructor and methods next
}

Step 2 — Add a constructor

The constructor is a special method inside the class that runs automatically when you make a new object.
Use it to initialize (set) the object's properties.

class Student {
  constructor(name, age, grade) {
    // this.name belongs to the object being created
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
}


Explanation: this means “the object we are creating right now”. this.name = name stores the passed name into the object.

Step 3 — Add a method
class Student {
  constructor(name, age, grade) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  displayInfo() {
    return `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}, Grade: ${this.grade}`;
  }
}
displayInfo() is shared by all student objects (not duplicated per object).

Step 4 — Create objects (instances)
const s1 = new Student("Ali", 20, "A");   // calls constructor automatically
const s2 = new Student("Sara", 19, "B");

Step 5 — Use the objects
console.log(s1.displayInfo()); // Name: Ali, Age: 20, Grade: A
console.log(s2.displayInfo()); // Name: Sara, Age: 19, Grade: B

Small variations & tips
Default values in constructor

class Student {
  constructor(name = "Unknown", age = 0, grade = "N/A") {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
}


If a value is not given, the default is used.
Add another method that changes state

class Student {
  constructor(name, age, grade) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
  displayInfo() { return `${this.name}, ${this.age}, ${this.grade}`; }
  updateGrade(newGrade) { this.grade = newGrade; } // mutates object
}

const s = new Student("Amina", 21, "B");
s.updateGrade("A");
console.log(s.displayInfo()); // Amina, 21, A


Objects created from classes are independent
Changing s1 does not affect s2.

Quick checklist to remember

Class = blueprint (use class MyClass {})
Constructor = special method constructor(...) that sets up new objects
new = makes a fresh object from the class and runs the constructor
this = refers to the object being created / used inside class methods




🏗️ 2. Constructor in JavaScript

A constructor is a special method inside a class that is called automatically when a new object is created.
It’s used to initialize object properties.

💻 Example:
class Car {
  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }
}

const car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
console.log(car1.brand); // Toyota

🧱 3. Object Constructor Function (Old Way)

Before class syntax, JavaScript used constructor functions to create objects.

💻 Example:
function Student(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.display = function() {
    console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`);
  };
}

const student = new Student("Hassan", 21);
student.display(); // Name: Hassan, Age: 21

🧰 4. Destructuring Objects

Destructuring allows us to unpack properties from objects into variables easily.

💻 Example:
const student = { name: "Ali", age: 20, grade: "A" };

// Destructuring
const { name, grade } = student;

console.log(name);  // Ali
console.log(grade); // A

🧾 5. Object Methods for Creating Objects
(A) Using an Object Literal

Simplest way — write the object directly.

const student = {
  name: "Ayesha",
  age: 19,
  display() {
    console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`);
  }
};

student.display();

(B) Using the new Object() Keyword

This creates an empty object, and then we add properties manually.

const student = new Object();
student.name = "Nidal";
student.age = 22;
student.display = function() {
  console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`);
};

student.display();

(C) Using an Object Constructor

This uses a function to create multiple objects with similar structure.

function Student(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const s1 = new Student("Ahmad", 18);
const s2 = new Student("Fatima", 20);

console.log(s1.name); // Ahmad
console.log(s2.name); // Fatima

(D) Using Object.assign()

This method copies properties from one or more source objects into a target object.

const person = { name: "Ali" };
const details = { age: 21, city: "Lahore" };

const student = Object.assign({}, person, details);
console.log(student); // { name: 'Ali', age: 21, city: 'Lahore' }

(E) Using Object.create()

Creates a new object and links it to an existing object (prototype-based).

const studentProto = {
  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`);
  }
};

const student = Object.create(studentProto);
student.name = "Zara";
student.age = 19;

student.displayInfo(); // Name: Zara, Age: 19

(F) Using Object.fromEntries()

Converts key-value pairs (like from Map or array) into an object.

const entries = [
  ["name", "Usman"],
  ["age", 23],
  ["city", "Karachi"]
];

const student = Object.fromEntries(entries);
console.log(student); // { name: 'Usman', age: 23, city: 'Karachi' }
