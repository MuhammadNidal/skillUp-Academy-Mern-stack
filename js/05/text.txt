🔁 1. for Loop
✅ Best for: When you know how many times the loop should run.
🔸 Syntax:
javascript

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be executed
}
🔸 Example:
javascript

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Step:", i);
}
🔍 How it works:
Step	Value of i	Condition	Output
Initialization	let i = 1	i <= 5	Run
1st loop	i = 1	true	Step: 1
2nd loop	i = 2	true	Step: 2
3rd loop	i = 3	true	Step: 3
4th loop	i = 4	true	Step: 4
5th loop	i = 5	true	Step: 5
6th loop	i = 6	false	Stops

🧠 Notes:
You can also decrement (i--) or step by 2 (i += 2)

Can loop backward as well

🔁 2. while Loop
✅ Best for: When you don’t know how many times it should run, and want to check the condition before the first run.
🔸 Syntax:
javascript

while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed
}
🔸 Example:
javascript

let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log("While Step:", i);
  i++;
}
🔍 How it works:
Checks i <= 5 before each run.

As soon as the condition is false, it exits.

⚠️ Warning:
javascript
Copy
Edit
while (true) {
  // Infinite loop if no break or condition update
}
🔁 3. do...while Loop
✅ Best for: When you want the code to run at least once, even if the condition is false.
🔸 Syntax:
javascript

do {
  // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
🔸 Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let i = 6;
do {
  console.log("Do While Step:", i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 5);
🔍 Output:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Do While Step: 6
👉 It ran once even though the condition was false, because check happens after execution.

🔁 4. for...in Loop
✅ Best for: Looping over object properties (keys).
🔸 Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let key in object) {
  // Code using object[key]
}
🔸 Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const user = {
  name: "Nidal",
  age: 22,
  country: "Pakistan"
};

for (let key in user) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${user[key]}`);
}
🔍 Output:
makefile
Copy
Edit
name: Nidal
age: 22
country: Pakistan
🧠 Notes:
Loops keys only

Can also be used on arrays, but not recommended:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const arr = [10, 20, 30];
for (let i in arr) {
  console.log(i, arr[i]); // Index and value
}
🔁 5. for...of Loop
✅ Best for: Looping over iterables like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
🔸 Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let item of iterable) {
  // Use item
}
🔸 Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
🔍 Output:
nginx
Copy
Edit
red
green
blue
✨ Works on strings too:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let char of "Nidal") {
  console.log(char);
}
🧠 Notes:
Use for...of for values

Cannot loop over object directly — must use Object.entries(), Object.values(), or Object.keys().
