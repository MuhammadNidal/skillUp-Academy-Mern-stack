4. Inheritance (extends, super)
🧠 Simple Explanation:

Inheritance means one class can use features of another class.
We use extends to connect them and super() to call parent constructor.

🧩 Example:
// Parent class
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

// Child class (inherits from Person)
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, grade) {
    super(name); // calls parent constructor
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  study() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is studying in grade ${this.grade}`);
  }
}

const student1 = new Student("Ali", 10);
student1.greet();  // from Person
student1.study();  // from Student

🧾 Explanation:

extends → connects child to parent

super() → calls parent constructor to use its properties

Child class gets access to parent methods automatically

🔒 5. Encapsulation (Private and Public Properties)
🧠 Simple Explanation:

Encapsulation means hiding details of how something works — so data can’t be accessed directly from outside the class.

We use:

Public properties → can be accessed anywhere.

Private properties → can only be used inside the class (with # in front).

🧩 Example:
class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // private property

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
    console.log(`Deposited: ${amount}`);
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance; // can access inside
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount();
account.deposit(500);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // ✅ Works
// console.log(account.#balance);  ❌ Error (private)

🧾 Explanation:

#balance → private, cannot access outside

Only class methods can use it safely

This keeps your data safe from direct modification

⚡ 6. Static Methods
🧠 Simple Explanation:

A static method belongs to the class itself, not to the objects created from it.

You call it using the class name, not the object.

🧩 Example:
class MathHelper {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(MathHelper.add(5, 10)); // ✅ 15

const obj = new MathHelper();
// obj.add(5, 10); ❌ Error - not available on object

🧾 Explanation:

static → makes method belong to class, not instance.

Used for utility/helper functions (like math operations, formatters, etc.).
